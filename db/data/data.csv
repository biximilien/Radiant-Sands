Though no longer involved with that gallery, I remain interested in photography as a medium – and committed to helping photographers find ways to present their work to the world.As director of Studio Sixty Six, I recently called for submissions for a show to be called The New Photographers. To my astonishment, I received over 100 portfolios from across Canada and the United States.I found myself with a luxurious problem – selecting a mere six photographers from a huge field of strong contenders. Those I have chosen offer, in my view, persuasive images of rare imagination.I am delighted to present The New Photographers for 2014:Brady Simpson, voted one of Alberta's top ten emerging photographers; Julie Sent of Seattle Washington ., who placed second in the 2010 and 2011 International Photography Awards Competition; Jennifer Bouchard, a recent BFA graduate of the University of Ottawa and winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Histoire et Mémoire exhibit at Montreal’s Maison de la culture Marie-Uguay; Olivia Johnston, a SPAO graduate whom Ottawa Magazine called “one of Ottawa’s more intriguing photo-artists”; Saleena Wedderburn, an Ottawa-based photographer whose striking self-portraits investigate issues of race and the definition of beauty; and Troy Moth, an award-winning photographer based in Vancouver.Carrie Colton, Gallery Director",http://couchassass.in/event/the-new-photographers,Couch Assassin

Join Carleton university music students Harea Band and Rommel Ribeiro for a night of music, dancing, and drinking to help you forget that you have months of papers and readings ahead of you. Doors: 9 pmCover: $10 Harea band: Harea Band is a collective. A collective made up of like minded individuals who want nothing more in life than to create high quality, enjoyable music. Led by singer/songwriter Alex Harea, the group takes catchy pop melodies, adds groovy riffs, tasty licks and funky beats which leave you with little choice but to smile and dance. Alex, along side bassist Harisson singer, drummer Mike Giamberardino, and guitarist/sample master Liam Meagher fulfill all elements of musical desire. With the ability to play toned down acoustic sets, they can play in venues of any size. Harea Band just released their debut EP ""Hip Hip Harea"" which showcases the band's songwriting skills as well as their nack for arranging and producing. ""Hip Hip Harea is a first-rate presentation of this trio’s overall sound, as well as the songwriting skills of Alex Harea. Overall the songs possess an enjoyable, buoyant and optimistic tone which is not over-produced, giving the uptempo melodies, as well as the ballad, an open atmosphere and jaunty mood that catches on quick."" -Dave Manning of Modularbase The band looks forward to taking the EP on the road and continuing on their path to success. www.hareaband.bandcamp.com Rommel Ribeiro: Singer, songwriter and guitarist, Rômmel Ribeiro was born into a family of accomplished artists in northern Brazil. Being surrounded by art, the musician was inspired by the work of great names as Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso still in a young age. In 2006, after releasing ""Transcendental"", his first album, he landed in Canada, where he crossed paths with the People Project Band. It was the perfect opportunity for exploring music in a multicultural background and for performing in relevant events, such as Montreal and Ottawa's Jazz Festivals, Ottawa Bluesfest and Toronto Global Groove. While honing his own style, Rômmel emerged with a mix of popular Brazilian music, afrobeat, reggae, funk and jazz in his second album ""Egológico Recycle"". Created in collaboration with musicians from Ethiopia, Cameroon, France and Brazil, this exotic disc unites compositions in French, Portuguese, Spanish and English. The high quality of his compositions, the ability to engender good partnerships and his inspired performances resulted in several awards in Canada. In 2010 he received the ""Great Revelation"" award at the Festival Nuits d'Afrique and the very first “Diversity Award”, granted by the Arts Council of Montreal and several other cultural organizations. Finally, in 2012 he was chosen as Radio Canada/CBC 2012-13 “Revelation on World Music”. This last prize opened up new doors for him in the music scene. Since then, Rommel had the honor of being the opening act for the concert of Gilberto Gil in November 2012. Also he was invited to record part of his third album in the excellent studio of Radio Canada/CBC in 2013. In 2014, the musician plans to release his new album “Nada Direito” and embark in a tour around Brazil and Europe. He promises breathtaking concerts, a deep musical miscegenation and inspirited compositions.
